# Section 17: Using SQL in Spark Applications

- In order to access a dataframe from SQL, Spark gives you two options.
  1. Create a Temporary view
  2. Create a Global view

## 17.1 Local Temp View

- Temp View is **_only valid within a Spark session_**, so it's not available in another notebook.
- Also, if you detach the notebook from the cluster and reattach it, this view is not available.

```python
# demo/4.sql_temp_view_demo

# MAGIC %run "../includes/configuration"

# Fetch the Dataframe (for which view needs to be created)
race_results_df = spark.read.parquet(f"{presentation_folder_path}/race_results")

# Step 1. Create temporary views on dataframes
race_results_df.createOrReplaceTempView("v_race_results")

# Step 2. Access the view from SQL Cell
%sql
SELECT * FROM v_race_results;

# Step 3. Access the view from Python Cell (and save it in Dataframe)
race_results_2019_df = spark.sql(f"SELECT * FROM v_race_results WHERE race_year = 2020")
display(race_results_2019_df)
```

## 17.2 Global Temp View

- Global Temp View is **_available within the entire application_**.
- **NOTE**: In the context of Databricks, an **_application is basically all the notebooks that are attached to the Databricks cluster_**. \
  So, any notebook we attach to this cluster here, will have access to the global temporary view.

```python
# demo/4.sql_temp_view_demo

# MAGIC %run "../includes/configuration"

# Fetch the Dataframe (for which view needs to be created)
race_results_df = spark.read.parquet(f"{presentation_folder_path}/race_results")

# Step 1. Create global temporary views on dataframes
race_results_df.createOrReplaceGlobalTempView("gv_race_results")

# Step 2. Access the view from SQL Cell
%sql
SHOW TABLES;
SHOW TABLES IN global_temp;
SELECT * global_temp.gv_race_results;

# Step 3. Access the view from Python Cell (and save it in Dataframe)
race_results_2019_df2 = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM global_temp.gv_race_results")
race_results_2019_df2.show()
display(race_results_2019_df2)

# Step 4. Acesss the view from another notebook
```
